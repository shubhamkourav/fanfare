## Usage

Fanfare can be used to quickly bootstrap SaaS applications with minimal configuration. You can:

- Customize UI components with TailwindCSS utility classes.
- Add new pages and components by following the Next.js routing conventions.
- Deploy the app to any Vercel-compatible platform for fast, serverless deployments.

## Customization
### TailwindCSS Configuration
You can extend or override the default TailwindCSS configuration by editing the ```tailwind.config.js``` file
```bash
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#4A90E2',
        secondary: '#50E3C2',
      },
    },
  },
};
```
### Theming and Layout
Modify the default layout by editing the ```app/layout.js``` file. You can easily switch between light and dark modes, and adjust the global styles.

## Adding New Pages
Next.js routing is file-based, so adding a new page is as simple as creating a file in the ```app/``` directory. For example, creating ```app/about/page.js``` will automatically generate a new route at ```app/```.


## Technologies
- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive UIs.
- **Node.js**: Used for running the development and production servers.
- **Vercel**: Deployment and hosting platform optimized for Next.js applications.
